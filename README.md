🏏 Test Cricket Batting Data Cleaning & EDA

This project involves cleaning and exploring a real-world dataset of Test cricket batting statistics. The goal is to transform messy, raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis, and to gain insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

⸻

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains historical Test cricket batting records for various players, including stats like:
	•	Matches played
	•	Runs scored
	•	Strike rate
	•	Batting average
	•	Highest innings score
	•	Playing span
	•	Player name with country

🚀 Project Steps

Step 1: Import Libraries

Essential libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are imported.

Step 2: Load the Dataset

The CSV file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing.

Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preparation
	•	Renamed columns for clarity.
	•	Handled missing values (Ball_Face, Strike_Rate, etc.).
	•	Removed duplicate entries.
	•	Extracted features like Country, Rookie-Year, and Final-Year from compound strings.
	•	Converted data types for proper analysis.

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Statistical summary of the dataset.
	•	Distribution of matches played.
	•	Correlation heatmap of numerical features.

Step 5: Top 10 Run Scorers
	•	Visualized the top 10 run-scorers in Test cricket using a bar chart.
